## [0.3.3] - 2026-04-18

### Added

#### Telnet server — additional RFC compliance
- **RFC 854 EC / EL**: `IAC EC` now surfaces to line-editors as `DEL` (0x7F)
  and `IAC EL` as `NAK` (0x15), with the `read_input_loop` handling NAK as
  "erase the current line."
- **RFC 859 STATUS** (option 5): `DO STATUS` is answered with `WILL STATUS`;
  `SB STATUS SEND` returns an `SB STATUS IS <state>` dump of every option
  advertised and not yet denied. Works with the Unix `telnet` client's
  `status` / `send status` subcommands.
- **RFC 860 TIMING-MARK** (option 6): `DO TIMING-MARK` is answered with
  `WILL TIMING-MARK` after flushing pending output, providing clients a
  processing-synchronization point.

#### Outgoing Telnet Gateway
- **IAC escape/unescape** in both directions; literal 0xFF data bytes now
  survive the wire without being mistaken for IAC.
- **Full RFC 1143 six-state Q-method** (`No`, `Yes`, `WantYes`,
  `WantYesOpposite`, `WantNo`, `WantNoOpposite`) for option negotiation.
- **Cooperative mode** (`telnet_gateway_negotiate = true`): proactively
  offers `WILL TTYPE`, `WILL NAWS`, and `DO ECHO` at connect; responds to
  `SB TTYPE SEND` with the local user's terminal type; responds to
  `DO NAWS` with the local user's current window size; forwards NAWS
  updates mid-session when the local user resizes.
- **Raw-TCP escape hatch** (`telnet_gateway_raw = true`): bypasses the
  telnet IAC layer entirely for destinations that aren't really telnet.
  Toggleable live from the Telnet Gateway menu with the **T** key; choice
  persists to `xmodem.conf`.
- **8 KiB subnegotiation body cap**: malicious remotes cannot exhaust
  memory by sending huge `SB` bodies without a terminating `IAC SE`.
- **Property-based fuzz test** (`qmethod_proptest`) covers the full Q-method
  state machine with randomized sequences. Regression corpus checked into
  `proptest-regressions/telnet.txt`.

#### Outgoing SSH Gateway
- **Public-key authentication** with auto-generated Ed25519 client keypair
  (`xmodem_gateway_ssh_key`, 0o600 on Unix). Tried before password; on
  acceptance, the password prompt is skipped entirely.
- **"Show gateway public key" menu**: press **K** at the SSH Gateway
  menu to display the one-line OpenSSH-format public key for pasting
  into a remote's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
- **Audit log for host-key trust decisions**: TOFU-accept, key-update,
  and key-reject events are written to `glog!` with host, port,
  algorithm, and SHA-256 fingerprint.

#### Hayes modem emulator
- **`A/` repeat-last-command** (no `AT` prefix, no CR required).
- **`ATI0`–`ATI7`** identification variants (product code, ROM checksum,
  ROM test, firmware, OEM, country, diagnostics, product info).
- **Stored phone-number slots**: `AT&Zn=s` stores a number in slot
  `n ∈ {0,1,2,3}`; `ATDS` / `ATDS<n>` dials it. Persisted by `AT&W`,
  restored by `ATZ`. Preserves hostname case so `AT&Z1=Pine.Example.com`
  works.
- **S-registers expanded to S0–S26**: S13–S24 are reserved-zero
  placeholders for legacy init strings; S25 (DTR detect time) and
  S26 (RTS/CTS delay) match Hayes defaults.
- **Dial-string modifiers**: `,` (pause by S8), `W` (wait-for-dialtone by
  S6), `;` (stay in command mode), `*`/`#` (preserved DTMF digits),
  `P`/`T`/`@`/`!` (accepted, ignored). Hostname heuristic prevents
  stripping `P`/`T`/`W` from names like `pine.example.com`.
- **ATX0–ATX4** result-code verbosity per RFC.
- **`AT&C` / `AT&D` / `AT&K`**: parsed, stored, persisted, displayed in
  `AT&V`. Actual hardware pins are not driven; see README limitations.
- **Silent-OK fallback** for unknown commands (`ATB`, `ATC`, `ATL`,
  `ATM`, `AT&B`, `AT&G`, `AT&J`, `AT&S`, `AT&T`, `AT&Y`, …) so legacy
  init strings don't halt mid-setup.

### Security

- **Shared per-IP brute-force lockout** across telnet and SSH servers.
  After 3 failed authentication attempts in 5 minutes, the source IP is
  blocked for 5 minutes across both protocols — an attacker can't bounce
  between them to reset the counter.
- **0o600 file permissions on Unix** for all sensitive files:
  `xmodem.conf`, `dialup.conf`, `gateway_hosts`, `xmodem_ssh_host_key`,
  `xmodem_gateway_ssh_key`.
- **Per-PID temporary filenames** for atomic config writes; closes a
  TOCTOU window on shared working directories.
- **`save_config` now acquires the `CONFIG` mutex before disk write**,
  so a concurrent session-side `update_config_values` can't clobber the
  GUI-initiated write.
- **SSH Gateway** now calls `session.disconnect` on every early-return
  path after authentication, preventing orphaned authenticated sessions
  on the remote.

### Fixed

- Q-method refusal flags (`sent_dont` / `sent_wont`) are now cleared on
  every contradicting-verb emission and set on every refusal emission
  (including the `WantYesOpposite → WantNo` transitions). Prevents
  duplicate refusal replies to a misbehaving peer. Caught by the
  proptest fuzzer.
- `gateway_telnet` local → remote direction now IAC-escapes outbound 0xFF
  data bytes correctly.
- `gateway_telnet` remote → local direction now parses inbound IAC rather
  than leaking protocol bytes to the user's terminal.

### Changed

- `gateway_ssh` prompt order: host/port/username first, then try pubkey
  auth, prompt for password only if pubkey is rejected. Matches how
  OpenSSH from the command line behaves.
- Hayes S7 default is now `15` seconds (capped internally at 60); the
  Hayes `50` second default was too slow for gateway users.

## [0.3.2] - earlier

- RFC compliance features for Telnet (RFC 854 / 855 / 857 / 858 /
  1073 / 1091 / 1143).
- Drain before "Press any key" to avoid CRLF stickiness.
- Security fixes and minor bug fixes.

## [0.3.1] - earlier

- Added web browser for user manual.
- Minor UI polish.

## [0.3.0] - earlier

- Added configuration options for telnet/SSH/serial servers.
- GUI for configuration editing (eframe/egui).
- Ring emulator and dialup directory.
- Windows build fix for `GetDiskFreeSpaceExW`.
- S-register persistence via `AT&W`.
